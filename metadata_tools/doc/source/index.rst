Introduction
============

Metadata tools is a package of Matlab based software components designed to
help unify the handling of metadata.  This package provides: 

#. a framework for defining metadata stucture via an XML based defaults tree,
#. a mechanism for specifying validation criteria and default values for metadata, 
#. system of checks and queries to determine if all required metadata has been acquired,
#. two different modes, "basic" and "advanced", for metadata entry and validation,
#. an automatically generated GUI dialog for user entry of metadata and
#. a mechanism for saving the metadata, to an XML file, after it has been acquired.
