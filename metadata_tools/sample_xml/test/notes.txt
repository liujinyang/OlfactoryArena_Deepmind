This folder contains some xml defaults files for testing aspects of the
XMLDefaults class.

1. session_test1_defaults.xml - this file contains nested session element
types and should fail when it is loaded for this reason.

2. session_test2_defaults.xm - this file contains session elements where the 
tree structure beneath the elements is not identical which should cause it to
raise an error when loaded.
